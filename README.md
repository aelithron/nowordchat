# ❌✍️💬 No Word Chat
Communicate past language barriers with ease! This is coded for Shipwrecked's Challenge 2, which makes us create an app that doesn't use text or numbers. Even though it is named No Word Chat, it actually doesn't allow any text or numbers to be entered, only emojis.

## Usage
Go to [noword.nova.hackclub.app](https://noword.nova.hackclub.app) and start messaging! You will get a random profile picture, which should persist. The app doesn't require log-in, as it is meant to be simple to use.
